# 🏙️ Optimization of a City Transportation Network (MST)

This project applies **Prim’s** and **Kruskal’s** algorithms in Java to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** that connects all city districts with the lowest total road construction cost.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Implementation of **Prim’s** and **Kruskal’s** MST algorithms  
- Comparison of execution time, operations, and total MST cost  
- Automated generation of results in `output_results.json` and `summary.csv`  
- MST visualizations using Python (`visualize_mst.py`)

---

## 📊 Results
Both algorithms produced identical MST costs for all datasets.  
- **Prim’s** performed slightly faster on dense graphs  
- **Kruskal’s** was more efficient on sparse graphs
